# oldcombat
Old Combat is a lightweight Fabric mod that allows players to switch between 1.8-style and 1.9+ PvP mechanics with a simple button inside the game.

ðŸ”˜ 1.8 Mode: Disables attack cooldowns for fast, classic-style PvP.
ðŸ”˜ 1.9+ Mode: Enables vanilla cooldowns for a more tactical combat experience.

The mod requires no configuration files and works out-of-the-box. Designed to be as simple as possible while giving you full control over your preferred combat style â€” all packed into a single .jar file.
